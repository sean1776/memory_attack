# memory_attack

A hybrid version of tic tac toe and memory game.
Enjoy!

## Getting Started
There are 4 sub-squares of 2 "X" and 2 "O" in each square of the tic tac toe.
The square will be draw by "O" if the 2 "O" are opened first, otherwise it will by draw by "X"

That's it!

Hope you gave a great time with your friend playing with it!
