A hybrid version of tic tac toe and memory game.
Enjoy!

## Getting Started
Basically, it's a tic tac toe game.
In each square of the tic tac toe, there are 4 sub-squares of 2 "X" and 2 "O".
The square will be drawn by "O" if 2 "O" are opened first, otherwise, it will be drawn by "X"
That's it!

Hope you have a great time with your friend playing with it!
